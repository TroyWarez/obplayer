# OpenBroadcaster Player

## Project Overview

OpenBroadcaster Player (OBPlayer) is an open-source media playback and broadcasting tool for radio stations and media professionals. It works with OBServer to play scheduled media but can also function as a standalone or network-controlled player. Designed for continuous broadcasting, OBPlayer syncs with OBServer to update schedules, media, and priority broadcasts. If the schedule has gaps, it plays a default playlist. If that fails, it switches to Fallback Media Mode, then to analog input bypass, and finally to a test signal as a last resort. OBPlayer always prioritizes valid Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages.

## Key Features
- Multi-format media playback (audio, video, images)
